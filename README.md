# MTP
Finding an optimal hikeable path from source to destination in a topographic map. One may characterise a hikeable route in many ways, e.g. by upper-bounding the gradient at every point along the route while minimising the length of the route. Preference can be given to roads while avoiding water bodies.

Algorithms used here:
- DTOCS
- Dijkstra
- A*
